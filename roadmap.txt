Roadmap for Lung Disease Detection Project

Phase 1: Research and Planning
1. Literature Review
    - Study existing methods for lung disease detection.
    - Identify gaps in current technologies.

2. Requirement Analysis
    - Define project goals and success metrics.
    - Identify datasets and tools required.

3. Dataset Collection
    - Gather publicly available lung scan datasets (e.g., CT scans, X-rays).
    - Ensure datasets include labeled cases of various lung diseases.

4. Ethical and Legal Compliance
    - Ensure compliance with healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
    - Obtain necessary permissions for dataset usage.

Phase 2: Data Preparation
1. Data Cleaning
    - Remove incomplete or low-quality scans.
    - Normalize image formats and resolutions.

2. Data Annotation
    - Label scans with disease types and severity levels.
    - Use medical experts for accurate annotations.

3. Data Augmentation
    - Apply transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling) to increase dataset diversity.

Phase 3: Model Development
1. Model Selection
    - Research and select suitable deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, transformers).

2. Model Training
    - Train models on annotated datasets.
    - Use transfer learning for faster convergence.

3. Model Evaluation
    - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
    - Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.
